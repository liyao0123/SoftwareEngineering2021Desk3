# Conclusion

## Working Practices

### Meeting and Communication

Though we never meet each other in real life, we all enjoy the time working with each other. We all talk until other people finish their expressions and we are keep good manners and try to understand other people. The diversity of different opinions could arise at any time. The important thing isn't to persuade people who hold a different view from you but to express yourself logically and objectively. What's more, we all present the meetings and classes in time, which enhanced our organization and awareness of responsibility. So, in this part, I think we had a good time with each other and learned to be good teammates during this project.

### Plan and Timeline Design
We've had an overall plan for the whole project and a timeline for the group. We think this gives us proper stress, making us more focused on the project and don't close behind. A plan is usually a dynamic one cause sometimes you will find your aim is too easy or too difficult, so when you find a situation is like that, it's time to modify the purpose and the plan. The timeline for the group will give every group member awareness of responsibility. So please stick to the timeline for the whole group, and also the individual timeline is especially an excellent way to improve our efficiency. The plan could also lead to disaster, and once you are out of timeline or delay the plan, we will find it harder to catch up. So when we find ourselves are kind of out of control, we will talk to another group member, adjust the mood before adjusting the plan.

### Implementation Capacity
Honestly speaking, this project isn't an easy task for us to complete, and we had faced a lot of problems when we did it. But we tried to finish our time since we don't want to let other group members down or make trouble for them. Iterating and time management are parts we emphasize a lot during our work, and we think these two characters will do a lot of help when we face problems and make us avoid stuck at some point. Moreover, implementation capacity can indicate your attitude towards work. If you have an excellent implementation capacity, you will be more focused on your position and have good efficiency. So in my view, the implementation capacity of our team is satisfying.

## Serious Play
Our games are not only included with entertainment but with some education. It requires users to recall the knowledge or activate their resolving power. Though our games are overall basic games, why we design a game like this matters. On the "serious" side, we want to emphasize a problem that all human beings are facing, that the biodiversity of our planet is declining. There are some limitations in designing the game. We have excellent and passionate ideas about the game design, but the game can still complete the goals: serious problem emphasizes and playful.

## Success discussion

### Goals Achievement

We have listed the team working goals and also the implementation goals. Finally, we've achieved all of them. Though some of those goals still had space for modification due to the time limitation, we temporarily leave the defects. And during the solving problems' time, we made a lot of progress in coding, materials collecting and so on. We have an overview of the web technologies we need in the future, and the web development progress learned how to cooperate with other group members. Thus, we achieved all of our goals. Though there are some minor defects and modification space, we still are proud of what we've achieved.

### Web Functionality
All of our web functionality works fine so far. The button and the card have a proper response when the user tries to click it. And the website's response to the request is fast and precise. But this also due to that our website is not full of interactive buttons. So as for this part, we all very satisfied with the web functionality.

### Web Design
We have put many efforts into beautifying the Web appearance. We spent a lot of time searching for high-quality images, designing the base color, word organization and buttons. The base color we use for this website is cyan, and it looks comfortable. Also, in the "Dynamic Earth" part, we try to make the dynamic earth more beautiful. The fonts we use are also selected and discussed. In conclusion, we think our website is good but still has a space to get modified.

### Team Work Success
During the work time, our team members were all very organized and easy to work with. We hold meetings regularly and communicate with each other sincerely and efficiently. And when we have a different opinion from other people, we are all the same respect other people. We believe communication is better than persuasion. And we all know that if we say something astonishing, we must have a reason for that, instead of quarreling with each other, being arrogant or stubborn, being patient and calm down will be a rather wise choice. In conclusion, we all think the most significant success within this project is not the technical harvest but the knowledge of working together with people.

## Covid Impacts

### Remotely Colloboration
Covid-19 hasn't caused any problem in our colloboration. All of us have a very steady mood, and we can keep good mental health. We are not terrified by the pandemic. Instead, the pandemic creates a quiet environment for us to concentrate. And also, maybe stay away from crowd boost our efficiency and make us more focus on our responsibility. Thanks to "Teams", it is an excellent software to communicate with each other, only because we are in a pandemic time we could know about such a superb corroboration software. In our view, Covid reversely helps us in the study.
### Team relationship
During the pandemic time, remotely corroboration becomes even more convenient for us. And chatting online even makes us more comfortable, maybe we are all the person who is a little shy. Chatting online allows us not to look at somebody's eyes, and people won't be able to see what we're doing. In this aspect, we won't be nervous at all. So the team relationship in our group is pretty good. Another reason I think maybe beneficial is that we always stick to the progress, and no one gets left behind. Therefore, there is no trouble from other members. Our smooth corroboration is also a good factor in the group relationship.

## Social and Ethical Implications
Our website doesn't store any user's data or cookies, so we don't have any ethical problems on the website aspect. 
The website we design is mainly aiming at educating people and promoting the idea of protecting rare animals. So it will have some benefits to society, which teaches us to respect diversity and understand how diversity contributes to our community. This website may have a good influence on society or may have no impact. At least it won't hurt. When we design this website, we used a questionnaire to collect people feeling about our website, including some personal information. Though it is an anonymous questionnaire, it still may have a conflict with GDPR. After the design and build process, we think deleting these data would be a safe way to protect personal privacy.

As for the public resources, we download the public code resources from GitHub and develop our website based on them. These open-source codes could simplify the work and do some good to a person or society. However, if they are used on some illegal act, it would deviate from the original intention of open source. In our project, we make use of public images and open-source codes to introduce the endangered fauna in an interesting way. This is very meaningful for the promotion and protection of wild animals.

## Future Work

### Web Frame
We think the web frame still have space to improve cause currently, the design has two entrance to the game page, which isn't what we want but we can't find out a better way to solve this defect. The balance between beauty and clearness is hard. Also, the "Dynamic Earth" part's animal description could be more clear and may be restructured. The link logic of different content parts could be reconsidered. Current logic may be a little confused. Web frame is essential for users since it may provide a clear framework for users to understand or confuse the user. We all need to focus on how to make a logical and beautiful web frame in the future.

### Pictures Quality
During the building process, we need to search for a lot of animal pictures. Many of them will need to be scaled. Most of them will face an aspect-ration problem. We need to process different types of images, which is a lot of trouble. Still, after a lot of effort, this part does have some defects. But due to time and energy limitations, we leave these minor defects. Learning how to get a proper aspect-ration picture is essential for the website's appearance. In the future, since we already gain some experience dealing with collected images, we will be more confident to do that. And in the next project, we think we could do better.

### Interactions Improvement
During this project, we have two interactive games which involve interactions with users. Due to the technical shortcoming, we could only implement fundamental interactions with users. In the future, we need to focus on this shortcoming aspect. Make a fantastic interaction is significant for improving the user's experience. Our website has some areas that can be improved. For example, the website can be made into an independent mobile application, adding the function of sharing to social media. In addition, the dynamic earth module can be added with a positioning function, which can provide users with information about endangered animals in their locations.

### Cooperation with a non-profit organization
Among the threats of endangered animals, the most common hazards are habitat loss and illegal hunting. There are thousands of animal rights activists who work all over the world to protect endangered animals. We can cooperate with animal protection organizations to prohibit illegal animal trade and hunting. In addition, we can work with environmental protection organizations to reduce people's destruction of wildlife habitats. Our application can be used as a medium for them to disseminate information.

## Summary
In conclusion, we think this project is a really impressive process. We learned how to work with each other nicely is the biggest harvest. And also, we learned about the difficulties we could encounter when we develop together. We find out our shortcomings. Next time, we could do better.
