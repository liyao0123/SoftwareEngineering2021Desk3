# Introduction
## Abstract
> "At least 40 percent of the world's economy and 80 percent of the needs of the poor are derived from biological resources. In addition, the richer the diversity of life, the more excellent the opportunity for medical discoveries, economic development, and adaptive responses to such new challenges as climate change. "

Biodiversity is the essential attribute of the ecosystem. It provides a rich life and boosts ecosystem productivity, which plays a vital role for the earth. Therefore it would be beneficial if we could gain more knowledge concern with the protection of endangered animals all over the world.
In this project, we designed a single-page application to help people recognize endangered animals in the wild, also promoting their awareness of environmental protection. This project isn't like a pure E-library which is only full of information about endangered animals. Our project could offer attractive interactions between the web page and users. An excellent designed web page and multi interactions would be a perfect way for promoting this knowledge.
By creating such a web page, we could have a more accessible and more attractive way to promote the idea of protecting endangered animals and raising the awareness of protecting animals and animals when they browse the web page.
## Objectives
This web page is designed for educating people with the knowledge of endangered species in an easier way. So the design and interactions of the web page are fundamental aspects. The objects of this project are in the following tables.
