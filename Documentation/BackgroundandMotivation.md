# Background and Motivation
## Background
### Context
    UN report: Humans accelerating extinction of other species
According to the united nations report there is nearly more than 1 million species are threatened with extinction. There will have a long time in the future for human beings, and however, for many endangered species, time is running out. They are dying out rapidly, which means we will have no chance to see or live with them on the earth. In general idea, human beings are the biggest threat to them. So it has a significant meaning that we need to strengthen our attention for protecting endangered species.
## Academic review
### Why biodiversity is important?
#### Ecosystem
Biodiversity helps the earth maintain the health condition of the ecosystem. As Paul R. and Anne Ehrlich, who are conservation researchers, pointed out in the 1980s, that a rich amount of species is a critical attribute of the ecosystem. Losing one species won't lead to a disaster, but we will face extinction ourselves if we keep losing species.
No matter where we live in a modern city like New York or a small rural village. We all depend on the fresh air, unpolluted water, and soil provided by a robust ecosystem. Ecosystems that are in horrible conditions couldn't offer things like these.
The dairy food we rely on also needs biodiversity. A good condition of biodiversity can contribute to modern agriculture and sustainable development. It supplies many vital ecosystem services, such as creating and maintaining healthy soils, pollinating plants, controlling pests, and providing habitat for wildlife, including fish and other species essential to food production and agricultural livelihoods.
Biodiversity is a crucial factor for good agricultural productivity. It makes a variety of contributions to the fields' livelihoods and reduces the shocks and stresses of the areas, providing a robust environment for crops.
#### Technology
Biodiversity can contribute to modern technology. Scientists do a lot of researches on animals. Biodiversity is a key factor in geodiversity. By researching different and unique animals, scientists could be inspired and motivated. There are already some inventions that were inspired by nature, such as radar and the airplane. What's more, researching different species could make us understand more about ourselves and the natural world.
#### Economy
At least 40 percent of the world’s economy and 80 percent of the needs of the poor are derived from biological resources.
Altogether, the food, commercial forestry, and ecotourism industries could lose US$ 338 billion per year if the loss of biodiversity continues at its current pace. For example, around 75 percent of global food crops rely on animals and insects to pollinate them. Still, many of these pollinator populations are in decline — which could put more than US$ 235 billion of agricultural products at risk. 
Meanwhile, The Economics of Ecosystems and Biodiversity (TEEB) initiative estimates that global sustainable business opportunities from investing in natural resources could be worth US$ 2 to 6 trillion by 2050.
Millions of people also depend on nature and species for their day-to-day livelihoods. This is particularly true for struggling communities in developing countries, who often turn to high-biodiversity ecosystems as their source of food, fuel, medicines, and other products made from natural materials for their use and as sources of income. Nature-related tourism is also a significant income generator for many people.
#### Disease
Biodiversity loss can increase the incidence and distribution of certain infectious diseases which are lethal for children. Diseases that spread from animals to humans are a severe threat: studies show that 75 percent of all emerging diseases come from wildlife, including COVID-19. Deforestation drives wild animals out of their natural habitats and closer to humans and is linked to 31 percent of outbreaks such as Ebola and the Zika and Nipah viruses. And climate change has altered and accelerated the transmission patterns of infectious diseases while contributing to human displacement.
### Why we need to promote the knowledge?
#### People's current knowledge
People have very little knowledge about endangered species. According to the report from BBC, Most people won't know the species is an endangered species even though that animal is just in front of you. So, it could be said like this, and nowadays people know nothing about wild animals except cows, pigs, sheep, horses. So, it won't be possible to expect people to know which animals are protected and rare.
#### Outdoor activity danger

#### Limit the commercial transaction

## Current Industry Review
### Context
There is already some website that plays a role of E-library or lists for endangered species. The following link is some of the authority websites. They have apparent content inside and good quality of articles and pictures. But what our group would like to achieve is to make things visually pleasing and easier to access. Promoting and raising the attention of protecting endangered species more acceptably, get everybody involved in actions in daily life.
### Example Website

The WWF is an outstanding non-profit organization that works towards the conservation of endangered animals, their website is full of articles about endangered animals news. They have a large amount of documentary videos.They also focus on the climate, fresh water and oceans. They have done a very excellent job in promoting the awareness of protecting animals. This website is more like an endangered animals news website, they don't have a list for the whole endangered animals species, nor have very detailed information and descriptions.However they still a very good website for people who is interested in animals and natural environment.

FWS is the Untied States' national wild animal information website. Since it has a good authority, so let's use it as an example. The website has much more details than the WWF, it documents more thoroughly. You can browse the wild life list by filtering by your living region and it gives you the rare condition of an anmal in time. What's more, you cna find some related regulations if you are a landowner or hunter. The FWS is a more detailed and specific website for local people. It's more like a local community website, it do provide a powerfl functionality for people who want to know the environment he is going to.But the shotcomings are local and no fun. If this website could be an international one and could have beautiful appearance, this website could be a really fantastic website.

NG(short for National Geographic) is a great organization and their website has a lot of contents about rare and endangered animals. The pros of the website are appearance, frame, pics, articles. The NG has a lot of exquisite pictures, they use photography to display the nature's beauty and the astonishing wild animals. Also they are making good impacts on making people explore nature, love nature. This website's articles may have some information about one rare animals, but it's hard to sort out the animal that you want to look for or search the rare animals in one specific region. In conclusion this website is mainly a photograph website towards natural environment.

## Problem Definition
From academic research we can see that the biodiversity is really important and people have very limited knowledge about recognizing endangered species. Currently existing websites are more like endangered animals news website, local website or photograh website. In order to fill this blank, we want to find an easier way of promoting  people's awareness of protecting wild animals. So the goals we need to achieve within this project are as follows.
* Beautiful website frame
* Interesting user interactions
* Descriptions about endangered species
#### These three main goals are the ways we use to solve the problem
Promoting the awareness of protecting endangered wild animals in an interesting way.
