For UX design, we followed the UX process provided by [UX mastery](https://uxmastery.com/resources/process), which includes research, analysis, design and production. In this part, we will focus on the first three phases since production phase will be covered in system implementation part. We use several techniques to better accomplish UX process. For example, we use questionnaires and interviews in research phase, and we analyze interacting users and stakeholders. Then, we considered the user stories that we would like to bring about. Finally, in the design phase, we utilized mood boards, wireframes, interaction flow diagram and generate a clickable prototype at last.

## Research

### Questionnaires

We did a quick survey after confirming our topic namely protecting wild endangered fauna. The survey includes questions about whether users have experienced similar website, what presenting method survey respondents prefer and what kinds of playful game they prefer. At the end, we ask respondents who are willing to participate our future interviews for emails so that we can get in touch with them later. The survey is still open, you can click the link below to view questions.

The result is within our expectation. We collected 59 responses in total. Most respondents have visited similar website, but they would like to have a better experience. More than 2/3 respondents think that 3D earth is the best way to present endangered animals. However, the result for playful game is close. After our discussion, we choose the first option namely numbers of funny questions about those animals' distribution and name.

## Analysis

### Interacting users

Combine the result and our thoughts, we considered the following user groups as the interacting users of our website.

- People who spend a lot of time in the wild such as hunters, geologist, archaeologist and so on
- People who are interested in protecting endangered fauna
- People who require a playful way to present endangered fauna such as biology teachers

### Stakeholder analysis

There are large numbers of stakeholders involved in this new website about protecting endangered animals. We will lay more emphasis on several primary stakeholders including users, endangered animals, some NGOs and our data suppliers.

We analyze stakeholders in two aspects namely interest and power. To begin with users, they have both strong interest and power related to our project since they can not only access our website to get information but also come up with opinions about the website. In addition, for endangered animals, they have little power but high interest to the website because they tend to benefit from this project. As for NGOs such as World Animal Protection and WildAid, we would not regard them as our competitors, but we do provide a different way to present endangered animals. Consequently, our creativity is likely to influence and benefit each other. Therefore, we believe that NGOs have high power and interest in the project. Finally, we choose Wikipedia as our data source, and since it is an open source, it will not gain from our project, but they have strong power since our data are in the charge of Wikipedia. 

We produced a power/interest matrix to demonstrate these stakeholders more straightforwardly which is shown below.

### User stories

- A user can see a dynamic 3D earth which is draggable on the website.
- There are some luminous points on the earth, and by using cursor to hover in a point, a user can preview the name and appearance of the endangered animal.
- A user can click the luminous points to access more detailed information about animals including distribution, description, threats and the link to Wikipedia.
- A user can play a mini game to test whether he understand the distribution of endangered animals and also consolidate the memory. The user should choose the right distribution area of a animal. Finally, a score and accuracy rate will be given according to the user’s choice.
- A user can play a mini game to test whether he can distinguish the name among wild animals with similar appearance. Finally, a score and accuracy rate will be given according to the user’s choice.
