# Introduction
## Abstract
    " At least 40 percent of the world’s economy and 80 percent of the needs of the poor are derived from biological
      resources. In addition, the richer the diversity of life, the greater the opportunity for medical discoveries, 
      economic development and adaptive responses to such new challenges as climate change. "
    
                               -----------------The Convention about Life on Earth, Convention on Biodiversity web site.

Biodiversity is the most important attribute of the ecosystem. It provides a rich life and boosts ecosystem productivity, which plays an important role in the earth. Therefore it would be beneficial if we could gain more knowledge concern with the protection of endangered animals all over the world.<br>
In this project, we designed a single-page application to help people recognize endangered animals in the wild, also promoting their awareness of environmental protection. This project isn't like a pure E-library which is only full of information about endangered animals but also offers attractive interactions between the web page and users. A nice designed web page and multi interactions would be a great way for promoting this knowledge.<br>
By creating such a web page, we could have an easier and more attractive way to promote the idea of protecting endangered animals. Raising the awareness of protecting animals and animals in people when they browse web page.
## Objectives
This web page is designed for educating people with the knowledge of endangered species in an easier way. So the design and interactions of the web page are very important aspects. The objects of this project are in the following tables.
